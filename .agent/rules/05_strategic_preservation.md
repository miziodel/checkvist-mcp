# 05 - STRATEGIC PRESERVATION

1. **No Erasure of Intent**: When updating `roadmap.md` or `backlog.md`, you MUST ensure that existing planned items are not deleted or overwritten unless explicitly requested. 
2. **Granular Edits Only**: Prefer `multi_replace_file_content` with small, specific chunks instead of large block replacements.
3. **Pre-Flight Content Check**: Before finalizing an edit to a strategic document, you MUST verify that the surrounding context (headers, other checklist items) remains untouched.
4. **Historical Continuity**: If a milestone is completed, move it to a "Recently Completed" section or mark it as `[x]` rather than deleting it, preserving the project's historical narrative.
