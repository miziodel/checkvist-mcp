# 02 - TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

1. **Automatic Tests Before Code (TDD)**: Every feature must have a failing test before implementation begins.
2. **Internalized TDD Workflow**: You MUST follow the standardized TDD procedure defined in `.agent/workflows/tdd-cycle.md` for any bug fix or new tool implementation.
3. **Scenario Mapping**: All technical changes must be mapped to a scenario in `tests/SCENARIOS.md`.
