# PROJECT LAWS

1. **Documentation First**: No implementation starts without a clear description in the docs or implementation plan.
2. **Automatic Tests Before Code (TDD)**: Every feature must have a failing test before implementation begins.
3. **MCP Ease of Use**: The server must be intuitive for LLM clients to consume.
4. **Organic Storage**: Checkvist must be treated as a fluid storage for notes and todos, not just a rigid database.
5. **No Blind Commits**: Final commits must ALWAYS be approved by the user before execution.
6. **Mandatory .venv**: All commands and development activities MUST be performed within the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).
7. **Relative Documentation Links**: All internal links between `.md` files must use relative paths. Absolute paths or `file://` URIs are prohibited to ensure portability.
