# Draft: Checkvist Power User Survey

**Context**: We are building an MCP server for Checkvist to help "Productivity Architects" automate their workflows via AI. We want to know which features YOU value most.

## 1. Demographic & Usage
- How long have you used Checkvist?
- Do you use a specific methodology? (GTD, PARA, Bullet Journal, Zettelkasten, Other)
- Are you primarily a keyboard-only user?

## 2. Feature Prioritization
Please rate these features from 1 (No interest) to 5 (Essential):

- **Automatic Inbox Triage**: AI suggests where to move your Inbox items based on your existing structure.
- **Weekly Review Assistant**: A tool that summarizes your progress and flags stale tasks across all lists.
- **Unified Agenda**: A single view for all upcoming/overdue tasks across all checklists.
- **Smart Linking**: Proactive suggestions of related tasks/notes when creating new items.
- **Template Variables**: Injecting names/dates into checklist templates at runtime.

## 3. Workflow Pain Points
- What is the most repetitive manual task you perform in Checkvist?
- If you could "ask" an AI one thing about your tasks, what would it be? (e.g., "What should I focus on today?")

## 4. Open-Ended
- What feature from other apps (Todoist, Obsidian, Notion) do you miss most in Checkvist?

**Next Step**: Post this to the Checkvist User Group / Forum.
