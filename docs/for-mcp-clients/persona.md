# User Persona: The Productivity Architect

## Core Identity
The **Productivity Architect** is a power user who treats their task manager not just as a to-do list, but as a custom-built operating system for their life and work. They are often developers, researchers, or managers of complex projects who value speed, hierarchy, and keyboard-driven efficiency.

## 🎯 Primary Goals
- **Total Information Control**: Capture ideas, tasks, and notes in a single, hierarchical structure.
* **Frictionless Workflow**: Minimize the distance between "thinking" and "recording". Mouse clicks are considered a failure of UI design.
* **Knowledge Synergy**: Discover connections between old notes and current tasks.

## 🧠 Mental Models & Methodologies
- **GTD (Getting Things Done)**: Obsessed with "Inbox Zero" and "Next Actions".
- **PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)**: Uses structural folders and numerical prefixes to maintain long-term order.
- **Keyboard-First**: Navigates via `LL` (list search), `MM` (move), and custom bookmarks. Speed is paramount.

## 😫 Pain Points (The "Entropy" Problem)
- **Inbox Chaos**: Rapidly capturing ideas leads to a messy inbox that requires tedious manual triage.
- **Context Loss**: Forgetting why a task was created or losing the link to original research notes.
- **Structural Maintenance**: Deep hierarchies (7+ levels) are powerful but hard to reorganize manually without losing focus.

## 🛠 Required Agent Behaviors (How we serve the Architect)
1. **Respect Keyboard Flow**: Never propose workflows that would be slower than manual keyboard shortcuts.
2. **Autonomous Triage**: Proactively suggest where to move items based on existing PARA/GTD patterns.
3. **Smart Linking**: Automatically find and link existing context (notes/previous tasks) to new entries.
4. **Hierarchical Integrity**: When moving or transforming tasks, always preserve the nested relationships.

## 🚀 Vision Alignment
The Checkvist MCP server must act as the "API" for this persona's biological brain, allowing them to use AI to maintain their system's order while they focus on high-leverage execution.
