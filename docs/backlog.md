# Checkvist MCP Server - Centralized Backlog

This document is the single source of truth for all planned improvements, architectural refinements, and vision-driven features.

## 🌟 Product Vision Features (The "Superpowers")
*Inspired by Linear, GitHub, and Superhuman.*

### Triage & Organization
- [ ] **Autonomous Inbox Smarts**: Auto-suggest categorization for items in "Inbox" based on historical project patterns.
- [ ] **Smart Snoozing (`Superhuman Style`)**: Tool to hide task branches until a specified date (via tagging or snoozing node).
- [ ] **WBS Expansion**: Tool to decompose a high-level goal into a hierarchical Work Breakdown Structure (5+ levels).
- [ ] **Hard Deletion Cleanup (Manual)**: Implement a way to physically delete tasks (bypassing logical `#deleted` archive) for space management or privacy.

### Context & Knowledge
- [ ] **Semantic Search (`Logseq/Roam Style`)**: Implement local vector embeddings for tasks to support "meaning-based" search (e.g., finding "sustainability" in "green energy" tasks).
- [ ] **Dependency Linking (`GitHub Style`)**: Implement `link_dependency(task_a, task_b)` to visually/logically mark blockers (e.g., "Blocks #123").
- [ ] **Meeting Synthesis**: Automated tool to parse transcripts and inject tasks directly into meeting nodes.

### Productivity Workflows
- [ ] **Variable Injection for Templates**: Enhance `apply_template` to support dynamic variables (e.g., `{{CLIENT_NAME}}`).
- [ ] **Progressive Distillation (`BASB Style`)**: Automated weekly cleanup to move stale items to "Archive/Stale" and generate progress summaries.

## 🛠 Stability & Architecture
- [ ] **Custom Exception Hierarchy**: Refactor `src/client.py` to raise typed exceptions instead of returning empty fallback values.
- [ ] **Strict Type Safety (Mypy)**: Reach 100% type hint coverage in `client.py` and enforce in CI.
- [ ] **Enhanced API Authentication**: Upgrade the authentication mechanism to be more robust (e.g., token rotation, OAuth support if applicable, or better secret management).
- [ ] **Centralized ID Coercion**: Move `int()` casting from `server.py` to `CheckvistService` for cleaner tool handlers.
- [ ] **Lazy Tree Fetching**: Optimize `get_tree` for extremely large checklists by fetching sub-branches on-demand.
- [ ] **Recursive Code Quality Review**: Establish a periodic automated or semi-automated pipeline/checklist to audit code sanity, performance, and best practices.

---

## 🧪 QA & Security
- [ ] **Resilience Testing**: Implement `tests/test_error_handling.py` (API 500s, 403s, Timeouts).
- [ ] **Input Sanitization**: Implement `tests/test_input_validation.py` to verify resilience against Type Poisoning.
- [ ] **Test Hierarchy**: Reorganize `tests/` into `unit/`, `integration/`, and `orchestration/` directories.
- [ ] **Secret Masking Audit**: Verify that `CHECKVIST_API_KEY` is never leaked in tool error outputs or logs.
- [ ] **Cross-List Permission Check**: Verify that `task_id` belongs to the provided `list_id` during operations.
