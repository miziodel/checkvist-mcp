# Checkvist MCP Server - Centralized Backlog

This document is the single source of truth for all planned improvements, architectural refinements, and vision-driven features.

## 🌟 Product Vision Features (The "Superpowers")
*Inspired by Linear, GitHub, and Superhuman.*

### Triage & Organization
- [ ] **Autonomous Inbox Smarts**: Auto-suggest categorization for items in "Inbox" based on historical project patterns. (Planned refine)
- [ ] **Hierarchical Search (`search_tasks_enriched`)**: Return task breadcrumbs to solve "Hierarchical Blindness". (Planned for **Phase 1.2**)
- [ ] **Smart Snoozing (`Superhuman Style`)**: Tool to hide task branches until a specified date (via tagging or snoozing node).
- [ ] **WBS Expansion**: Tool to decompose a high-level goal into a hierarchical Work Breakdown Structure (5+ levels).
- [ ] **Hard Deletion Cleanup (Manual)**: Implement a way to physically delete tasks (bypassing logical `#deleted` archive) for space management or privacy.

### Context & Knowledge
- [ ] **Semantic Search (`Logseq/Roam Style`)**: Implement local vector embeddings for tasks to support "meaning-based" search. (Planned for **Phase 2.0**)
- [ ] **Dependency Linking (`GitHub Style`)**: Implement `link_dependency(task_a, task_b)` to visually/logically mark blockers (e.g., "Blocks #123").
- [ ] **Meeting Synthesis**: Automated tool to parse transcripts and inject tasks directly into meeting nodes.

### Productivity Workflows
- [ ] **Progressive Distillation (`BASB Style`)**: Automated weekly cleanup to move stale items to "Archive/Stale" and generate progress summaries.

### High-Performance Bulk Operations
- [ ] **Native Bulk Re-parenting**: Use `/move.json` for complex reorganization without iterative calls (Planned refine).
- [ ] **Task Styling API**: Implement tool for setting Priority (marks) and Boldness via native `details` endpoint.

---

## 🛠 Stability & Architecture
- [ ] **Strict Type Safety (Mypy)**: Reach 100% type hint coverage in `client.py` and enforce in CI.
- [ ] **Enhanced API Authentication**: Upgrade the authentication mechanism to be more robust (e.g., token rotation, OAuth support if applicable, or better secret management).
- [ ] **Centralized ID Coercion**: Move `int()` casting from `server.py` to `CheckvistService` for cleaner tool handlers.
- [ ] **Recursive Code Quality Review**: Establish a periodic automated or semi-automated pipeline/checklist to audit code sanity, performance, and best practices.

---

## 🧪 QA & Security
- [ ] **Test Hierarchy**: Reorganize `tests/` into `unit/`, `integration/`, and `orchestration/` directories.
- [ ] **Cross-List Permission Check**: Verify that `task_id` belongs to the provided `list_id` during operations.

## 📊 User Research & Metrics
*Emerged from 2026-02-01 Strategic Debate*

### User Behavior Research
- [ ] **User Persona Validation**: Validate "Final User" persona with real user feedback (Initial validation done in research doc).
- [ ] **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Identify common task organization patterns to inform AI triage logic. -> *Initial heuristics defined in `docs/research/smart_triage_heuristics.md`*.

### Metrics & Observability
- [ ] **Tool Success Rate Tracking**: Implement telemetry to measure success rate per tool (target: 95%+ for Stable tools)
- [ ] **API Call Efficiency Metrics**: Track API calls per workflow to validate optimization efforts
- [ ] **User Trust Score**: Implement periodic user feedback mechanism (1-10 scale)
- [ ] **Error Message Clarity Rating**: Collect user feedback on error message usefulness

### Phase 7: Performance & Velocity (PERF)
*New focus area from Productivity Architect validation*
- [ ] **Benchmark Suite**: Implement `tests/test_benchmark.py` for Triage (target < 30s) and Tree Fetch (target < 5s).
- [ ] **Latency Monitoring**: Add `X-Response-Time` tracking to all service calls.

## 🎯 Debate-Driven Priorities (2026-02-01)
*Immediate actions from multi-persona strategic debate*

### High (Week 2)
- [ ] **Resource Lifecycle Tests**: Add automated tests for client shutdown and timeout enforcement

### Medium (Week 3)
- [ ] **Tool Sunset Policy**: Define criteria for deprecating unused/unreliable tools

---

## 🧠 Knowledge Capture & Reusability
*Patterns to extract for cross-workspace use*

- [ ] **Multi-Persona Debate Pattern**: Convert debate methodology into reusable workflow/skill
- [ ] **Extreme Consequence Analysis**: Formalize risk exploration technique
- [ ] **Tool Maturity Framework**: Extract as reusable pattern for any tool-based project
- [ ] **User Trust Metrics**: Generalize trust measurement approach
